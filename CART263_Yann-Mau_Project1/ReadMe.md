Think Think Revolution by Yann-Maurice McNiven

In Think Think Revolution you work to help Sisyphus discover the meaning of life, an ultimately endless effort.
Much like in his original task Sisyphus is doomed to ponder on the details and mysteries of life for all eternity, but
that doesn't mean we can't have fun while we help him. The player in this case is the force of inspiration, and by
hitting the correct keys you inspire Sisyphus. Nowhere does it say that the game is un-winnable, it is endless, and
so for the player the only way to escape the curse of Sisyphus is to stop playing and stop dwelling on this question.
Just as Sisyphus is trapped by the gods to perform feats that are endless, so is the player trapped by the Creator,
 trying to achieve the untenable task of being awakened in lucidity to the complexity of the human experience.
Sisyphus' character has been contemplated, lionized and mythologized by thinkers such as Camus to explain our own
existential dread, but in playing this game, one understands the futility of the endeavor.  I am interested in how our emancipation
is in contemplating in tandem, seeing the fractals of truth in the Other, and in togetherness coming to quell our profound fears.

I based the game off of the classic arcade game Dance Dance Revolution, a game which if endless would surely be
in the pantheon of ancient greek punishments. Hitting the corresponding keys plays an approving sound, almost
reassuring the player to keep trying their best. Ultimately there is no score and no point to playing, Sisyphus moves
and changes position with every five points. I did my best to create the impression of a animated greek pottery scene,
the effect relying on the classic orange and black colors often seen in that art.

I had a lot of difficulty with figuring out how to locate the element on the page, this was my main obstacle in making
the game. The challenge was my deciding on using a .draggable & .droppable effect on my Arrows and Static arrows.
I also was having a lot of difficulty locating individual arrows, most of my time was spent on creating the fundamental
game mechanics; then when running into a roadblock and having exhausted my conceivable google searches I put it
aside to ask for help in person, I moved onto creating the next feature and made the best use of my time that way.

The game finally came together after doing some in class work with Professor Pippin Barr who reminded me of the $('this')
selector and enlightened me as to how to properly use .offset. The final effect was to calculate position from the top of .each
arrow in the class up/down/left/right arrow and subtracting that from the static arrow. If the arrow was within the range and
the directional arrow was clicked then a point is scored and the arrow changes images and plays a sound. Overall I'm pleased
with the result and this has given me a far better understanding of Jquery & Jquery UI.
