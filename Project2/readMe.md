In Children's Avatar Maker 2019 Edition you utilize assets from different children's cartoons,
video games, and movies to create a unique and often disturbing looking avatar. The goal
I set out to achieve when making this game was to capture the very essence of "Something
is wrong on the internet", the raw creepiness of mixing innocent colorful imagery meant for
children with randomness. This is can lead to very peculiar examples such as Peppa the pig's
head on the body of an overweight zombie, or the body of Mario with the head of the Joker.
In the game you get to make your own Avatar while the finger family music plays in the background
by clicking on the different disjointed body parts you cycle through different combinations ranging
from obvious choices to wildly inappropriate and scary. I wanted to also play with the auditory
since the music and the videos that the article spoke of are so out there to begin with. I feel like
children's music strangely would fit very well indeed in a horror movie, the sing songy happiness
almost hiding some deeper more disturbing intentions. Well I brought that out by making it so with
every click up to about 120 clicks makes the music more and more corrupt until the music is so
corrupted it's impossible to listen to. Initially I had wanted to create a project with a little more polish
to it, and was upset by how the cut out images seemed to refuse to co-opperate with that vision. However
on further reflection I've come to see it as being completely indicative of that very style which
I was trying to emulate, a disjointed, non-functioning, un-polished combination of elements, randomly
assembled to form something passed up to children as content. I certainly encountered some difficulty
in making this program, mainly the segmenting of the bodies took longer then expected, but also
managing the different image arrays, removing and pushing new images from the unlock array into the
active array. However I also found the project incredibly fun to work on, it made me feel more
comfortable with Jquery, Jquery UI, annyang and it has made me excited to work with it in the future knowing
I could assemble most of this without too much difficulty. It also made me think about what
kind of media we were exposing to the youth of today, how protected my own childhood was
from unregulated content. How we as a society who have historically and still currently been
very concerned with the kinds of media our children are seeing and the effects it may be having on their
psyche have willingly and seemingly without any notice handed the privilege of young minds
over to anonymous content makers, some with good intent, but obviously others with dubious, disturbing
intents. What would Mr.Rogers say, honestly I think he'd be pretty disturbed and possibly even him
be upset by this whole affair.
